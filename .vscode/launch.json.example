    // This example presents a typical configuration for SAMV71Q21 debugging via remote OpenOCD.
    // To use it, change `executable` to correct path to debugged executable, and make sure to
    // rebuild it manually. This can easely be automated by custom task and "preLaunchTask"
    // argument, but since it's hard to create a generic solution that would work with examples
    // without modifying this file, it's left to user of this config to do so.
